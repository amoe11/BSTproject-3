# Binary Search Tree and Linked List Integration

This C++ project demonstrates the integration of data structures and basic algorithms to manage and process a series of randomly generated numbers.
It highlights the use of a linked list to store numbers in the order they were generated and a binary search tree (BST) for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.
The project also showcases different ways to traverse a BST to explore data structure behavior.

## Project Features

- Random Number Generation**: Generates 40 random natural numbers less than 100. These numbers are used to demonstrate data structure operations and their effects.
- Linked List**: Stores the generated numbers in their original sequence of generation. This list helps trace the order in which elements are added to the binary search tree.
- Binary Search Tree (BST)**:
  - Dynamic Insertion**: Each generated number is inserted into a BST, maintaining the order properties of the BST where each node's left child contains a lesser value and the right child contains a greater value.
  - Traversal Methods**: Implements and demonstrates three types of BST traversals:
    - In-order Traversal**: Visits nodes in ascending order, useful for displaying the tree's contents as sorted.
    - Pre-order Traversal**: Visits the root before its subtrees, useful for cloning or serializing the tree.
    - Post-order Traversal**: Visits the root after its subtrees, useful for deleting the tree or performing operations that require children to be processed before the parent.
